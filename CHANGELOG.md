## [Unreleased](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/tree/master)

[Commits](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/compare/3.0.0...master)

### Added

* Sync functionality to ``download`` and ``upload`` commands.
* ``--use-audio-hash/--no-use-audio-hash`` option to
  ``download`` and ``upload`` commands.
* ``--use-metadata/--no-use-metadata`` option to
  ``download`` and ``upload`` commands.
* Options to exclude local filepaths in different ways:
  * ``-xp, --exclude-path``
  * ``-xr, --exclude-regex``
  * ``-xg, --exclude-glob``

### Changed

* Use argparse instead of click for CLI.
* Refactor ``download``, ``sync``, and ``upload`` commands.
  * Remove sync commands.
  * Add sync options to ``download`` and ``upload`` commands:
    * ``--use-audio-hash/--no-use-audio-hash`` to sync based on
	  audio hash of file as generated by Google Music.
	* ``--use-metadata/--no-use-metadata`` to sync based on metadata.

### Removed

* ``sync`` commands.


## [3.0.0](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/releases/tag/3.0.0) (2019-01-15)

[Commits](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0)

### Added

* Option to specify external album art names/paths with upload commands.
* ``--no-sample`` option to ``gms upload`` and ``gms sync up``.
  This sends an empty audio sample instead of creating one with ffmpeg/avconv.
  If uploading MP3s, this option completely removes the ffmpeg/avconv requirement.
  Otherwise, this will save time/bandwidth by not creating nor sending a sample.

### Changed

* ``--filters`` long option to ``--filter``.

### Removed

* Transcoding options from upload commands.
  See [#9](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/issues/9)
  for explanation.

### Fixed

* ``TypeError`` when sorting Google Music songs due to no defaults
  being set for ``get`` calls.


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/releases/tag/2.0.0) (2018-11-26)

[Commits](https://github.com/thebigmunch/google-music-scripts/compare/1.1.1...2.0.0)

### Added

* Configuration file.
* Ability to set option defaults in configuration file.

### Changed

* Filtering is now done through one option ``-f, --filters`` with different syntax and semantics.
	* ``+field[value]`` is the new syntax for an include filter condition.
	* ``-field[value]`` is the new syntax for an exclude filter condition.
	* Multiple filters can be set in one call. 
	* Multiple conditions can be chained in one filter.
	* Values can still be valid Python regex.
	* Matching is still done case-insensitively.

  E.g:
	* ``gms download -f 'artist[Beck]+album[Guero]-title[E-Pro]'``
	  would download all songs by Beck from the album Guero without E-Pro in the title.
	* ``gms download -f 'artist[Beck]+album[Guero]-title[E-Pro]' -f 'artist[Daft Punk]'``
	  would download all songs by Beck from the album Guero without E-Pro in the title
	  as well as all songs by Daft Punk.

### Removed

* Legacy command entry points (gmupload, gmdownload, etc).
  Use the ``gms`` subcommands instead.
